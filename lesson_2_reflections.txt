What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository git starts tracking its contents and whenever I submit a commit some newer version of a project/directory is being added to a history of changes. Therefore, I can quickly revert state of project to other specified state in a past.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a place where we put some parts of our change (some files, etc.) in order not to make a single huge commit. It can be used in cases when there are multiple changes in many files.
